## Overview of Analysis:

Roza at Improbable Beef has a partially completed dashboard that has a panel for demographic information on belly button biodiversity.  We have now added a way for her volunteers to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their bell buttons with a bar chart and a bubble chart.  we have also added a guage chart that displays the volunteers weekly washing frequency.


## Resources:

Software: 
Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda 4.10.1, Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code 1.56.0

## Webpage Use:

To use the webpage you must select the "Test Subject ID no." (ID).  Once an ID number is selected the volunteers information is auto populated into 3 sections, "Top 10 Bacteria Cultures Found", "Belly Button Washing Frequency: Scrubs Per Week", and "Bacteria Cultures Per Sample".


## Summary:

Roza can now have her volunteers visit the webpage and find all of their information.  They can now be able to identify whether the bacteria is present in their bell buttons to manufacture synthetic beef, if Improbable Beef identifies a species.
